*For macOS:
1. You can install with Homebrew (if you have it):

Create an account (you can use your email or your GitHub/Google account)

3. Get your Authtoken
Once you're in the ngrok dashboard, go to:
ðŸ‘‰ https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

You'll see a line similar to:

ngrok config add-authtoken 2Ktxb2XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

4. Run this command in your terminal.
Copy and paste exactly as you see it in ngrok, for example:

ngrok config add-authtoken 2Ktxb2XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
This links your local installation to your free account.

5. Rerun ngrok

ngrok http 8889

And you will see something like this:

Forwarding https://abc123.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8889
